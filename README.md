## KEEP ME OFF THE STREETS ##
A simple, Flatiron School-specific budgeting CLI app

The purpose of this CLI app is to calculate how much money you should spending per week (or per day) based on how much you have in your bank account, taking into consideration how many more weeks of the course there are...ideally keeping you off the streets.  There is also the ability to give yourself some "cushion" and end the semester with some green still in your pocket.

Limitations/Future Opportunities
- User entries have to be entered correctly
- The data is not saved, so each time you use the app you have to re-enter your information.
- There's no way to separate checking vs savings account for a more detailed breakdown.

Please give feedback / iterate on my work to improve the program! Message me for collaborator rights!
